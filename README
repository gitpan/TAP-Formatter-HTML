NAME
    TAP::Formatter::HTML - TAP Test Harness output delegate for html output

SYNOPSIS
     ##
     ## command-line usage (alpha):
     ##
     prove -m -Q -P HTML=outfile:out.html,css_uri:style.css,js_uri:foo.js,force_inline_css:0

     # backwards compat usage:
     prove -m -Q --formatter=TAP::Formatter::HTML >output.html

     # for more detail:
     perldoc App::Prove::Plugin::HTML

     ##
     ## perl usage:
     ##
     use TAP::Harness;

     my @tests = glob( 't/*.t' );
     my $harness = TAP::Harness->new({ formatter_class => 'TAP::Formatter::HTML',
                                       merge => 1 });
     $harness->runtests( @tests );
     # prints HTML to STDOUT by default

     # or if you really don't want STDERR merged in:
     my $harness = TAP::Harness->new({ formatter_class => 'TAP::Formatter::HTML' });

     # to use a custom formatter:
     my $fmt = TAP::Formatter::HTML->new;
     $fmt->css_uris([])->inline_css( $my_css )
         ->js_uris(['http://mysite.com/jquery.js', 'http://mysite.com/custom.js'])
         ->inline_js( '$(div.summary).hide()' );

     my $harness = TAP::Harness->new({ formatter => $fmt, merge => 1 });

     # to output HTML to a file[handle]:
     $fmt->output_fh( $fh );
     $fmt->output_file( '/tmp/foo.html' );

     # you can use your own customized templates too:
     $fmt->template('custom.tt2')
         ->template_processor( Template->new )
         ->force_inline_css(0)
         ->force_inline_js(0);

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides HTML output formatting for TAP::Harness (a
    replacement for Test::Harness. It is largely based on ideas from
    TAP::Test::HTMLMatrix (which was built on Test::Harness and thus had a
    few limitations - hence this module). For sample output, see:

    <http://www.spurkis.org/TAP-Formatter-HTML/test-output.html>

    This module is targeted at all users of automated test suites. It's
    meant to make reading test results easier, giving you a visual summary
    of your test suite and letting you drill down into individual failures
    (which will hopefully make testing more likely to happen at your
    organization ;-).

    The design goals are:

    *   *easy to use*

        Once you've got your test report, it should be obvious how to use
        it.

    *   *helpful*

        It should be helpful by pointing out *where* & *why* your test suite
        is breaking. If you've written your tests well, it should give you
        enough info to start tracking down the issue.

    *   *easy to install*

        Eg: should be a clean install from CPAN, and you shouldn't need to
        modify your existing test suite to get up & running, though *you
        will need to stop using Test::Harness unfortunately*.

    *   *work out of the box*

        You shouldn't need to do any custom-coding to get it working - the
        default configuration & templates should be enough to get started
        with. Once installed it should be a matter of running:

         % prove -m -Q --formatter=TAP::Formatter::HTML >output.html

        From your project's home dir, and opening the resulting file.

    *   *easy to configure*

        You should be able to configure & customize it to suit your needs.
        As such, css, javascript and templates are all configurable.

METHODS
  CONSTRUCTOR
   new
      my $fmt = $class->new({ %args });

  ACCESSORS
    All chaining accessors:

   verbosity
      $fmt->verbosity( [ $v ] )

    Verbosity level, as defined in "new" in TAP::Harness:

         1   verbose        Print individual test results (and more) to STDOUT.
         0   normal
        -1   quiet          Suppress some test output (eg: test failures).
        -2   really quiet   Suppress everything to STDOUT but the HTML report.
        -3   silent         Suppress all output to STDOUT, including the HTML report.

    Note that the report is also available via "html". You can also provide
    a custom "output_fh" (aka "output_file") that will be used instead of
    "stdout", even if *silent* is on.

   stdout
      $fmt->stdout( [ \*FH ] );

    An IO::Handle filehandle for catching standard output. Defaults to
    "STDOUT".

   output_fh
      $fmt->output_fh( [ \*FH ] );

    An IO::Handle filehandle for printing the HTML report to. Defaults to
    the same object as "stdout".

    Note: If "verbosity" is set to "silent", printing to "output_fh" will
    still occur. (that is, assuming you've opened a different file, not
    "STDOUT").

   output_file
      $fmt->output_file( $file_name )

    Not strictly an accessor - this is a shortcut for setting "output_fh",
    equivalent to:

      $fmt->output_fh( IO::File->new( $file_name, 'w' ) );

    You can set this with the "TAP_FORMATTER_HTML_OUTFILE=/path/to/file"
    environment variable

   escape_output
      $fmt->escape_output( [ $boolean ] );

    If set, all output to "stdout" is escaped. This is probably only useful
    if you're testing the formatter. Defaults to 0.

   html
      $fmt->html( [ \$html ] );

    This is a reference to the scalar containing the html generated on the
    last test run. Useful if you have "verbosity" set to "silent", and have
    not provided a custom "output_fh" to write the report to.

   tests
      $fmt->tests( [ \@test_files ] )

    A list of test files we're running, set by TAP::Parser.

   session_class
      $fmt->session_class( [ $class ] )

    Class to use for TAP::Parser test sessions. You probably won't need to
    use this unless you're hacking or sub-classing the formatter. Defaults
    to TAP::Formatter::HTML::Session.

   sessions
      $fmt->sessions( [ \@sessions ] )

    Test sessions added by TAP::Parser. You probably won't need to use this
    unless you're hacking or sub-classing the formatter.

   template_processor
      $fmt->template_processor( [ $processor ] )

    The template processor to use. Defaults to a TT2 Template processor with
    the following config:

      COMPILE_DIR  => catdir( tempdir(), 'TAP-Formatter-HTML' ),
      COMPILE_EXT  => '.ttc',
      INCLUDE_PATH => join(':', @INC),

   template
      $fmt->template( [ $file_name ] )

    The template file to load. Defaults to
    "TAP/Formatter/HTML/default_report.tt2".

    You can set this with the "TAP_FORMATTER_HTML_TEMPLATE=/path/to.tt"
    environment variable.

   css_uris
      $fmt->css_uris( [ \@uris ] )

    A list of URIs (or strings) to include as external stylesheets in
    <style> tags in the head of the document. Defaults to:

      ['file:TAP/Formatter/HTML/default_report.css'];

    You can set this with the
    "TAP_FORMATTER_HTML_CSS_URIS=/path/to.css:/another/path.css" environment
    variable.

    If you're using Win32, please see "WIN32 URIS".

   js_uris
      $fmt->js_uris( [ \@uris ] )

    A list of URIs (or strings) to include as external stylesheets in
    <script> tags in the head of the document. Defaults to:

      ['file:TAP/Formatter/HTML/jquery-1.2.6.pack.js'];

    You can set this with the
    "TAP_FORMATTER_HTML_JS_URIS=/path/to.js:/another/path.js" environment
    variable.

    If you're using Win32, please see "WIN32 URIS".

   inline_css
      $fmt->inline_css( [ $css ] )

    If set, the formatter will include the CSS code in a <style> tag in the
    head of the document.

   inline_js
      $fmt->inline_js( [ $javascript ] )

    If set, the formatter will include the JavaScript code in a <script> tag
    in the head of the document.

   minify
      $fmt->minify( [ $boolean ] )

    If set, the formatter will attempt to reduce the size of the generated
    report, they can get pretty big if you're not careful! Defaults to 1
    (true).

    Note: This currently just means... *remove tabs at start of a line*. It
    may be extended in the future.

   abs_file_paths
      $fmt->abs_file_paths( [ $ boolean ] )

    If set, the formatter will attempt to convert any relative *file* JS &
    css URI's listed in "css_uris" & "js_uris" to absolute paths. This is
    handy if you'll be sending moving the HTML output around on your
    harddisk, (but not so handy if you move it to another machine - see
    "force_inline_css"). Defaults to *1*.

   force_inline_css
      $fmt->force_inline_css( [ $boolean ] )

    If set, the formatter will attempt to slurp in any *file* css URI's
    listed in "css_uris", and append them to "inline_css". This is handy if
    you'll be sending the output around - that way you don't have to send a
    CSS file too. Defaults to *1*.

    You can set this with the "TAP_FORMATTER_HTML_FORCE_INLINE_CSS=0|1"
    environment variable.

   force_inline_js( [ $boolean ] )
    If set, the formatter will attempt to slurp in any *file* javascript
    URI's listed in "js_uris", and append them to "inline_js". This is handy
    if you'll be sending the output around - that way you don't have to send
    javascript files too.

    Note that including jquery inline doesn't work with some browsers,
    haven't investigated why. Defaults to *0*.

    You can set this with the "TAP_FORMATTER_HTML_FORCE_INLINE_JS=0|1"
    environment variable.

  API METHODS
   summary
      $html = $fmt->summary( $aggregator )

    "summary" produces a summary report after all tests are run. $aggregator
    should be a TAP::Parser::Aggregator.

    This calls:

      $fmt->template_processor->process( $params )

    Where $params is a data structure containing:

      report      => %test_report
      js_uris     => @js_uris
      css_uris    => @js_uris
      inline_js   => $inline_js
      inline_css  => $inline_css
      formatter   => %formatter_info

    The "report" is the most complicated data structure, and will sooner or
    later be documented in "CUSTOMIZING".

CUSTOMIZING
    This section is not yet written. Please look through the code if you
    want to customize the templates, or sub-class.

    You can use environment variables to customize the behaviour of TFH:

      TAP_FORMATTER_HTML_OUTFILE=/path/to/file
      TAP_FORMATTER_HTML_FORCE_INLINE_CSS=0|1
      TAP_FORMATTER_HTML_FORCE_INLINE_JS=0|1
      TAP_FORMATTER_HTML_CSS_URIS=/path/to.css:/another/path.css
      TAP_FORMATTER_HTML_JS_URIS=/path/to.js:/another/path.js
      TAP_FORMATTER_HTML_TEMPLATE=/path/to.tt

    This should save you from having to write custom code for simple cases.

WIN32 URIS
    This module tries to do the right thing when fed Win32 File *paths* as
    File URIs to both "css_uris" and "js_uris", eg:

      C:\some\path
      file:///C:\some\path

    While I could lecture you what a valid file URI is and point you at:

    http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/12/06/file-uris-in-windows.aspx

    Which basically says the above are invalid URIs, and you should use:

      file:///C:/some/path
      # ie: no backslashes

    I also realize it's convenient to chuck in a Win32 file path, as you can
    on Unix. So if you're running under Win32, "TAP::Formatter::HTML" will
    look for a signature 'X:\', '\' or 'file:' at the start of each URI to
    see if you are referring to a file or another type of URI.

    Note that you must use '"file:///C:\blah"' with *3 slashes* otherwie
    '"C:"' will become your *host*, which is probably not what you want. See
    URI::file for more details.

    I realize this is a pretty basic algorithm, but it should handle most
    cases. If it doesn't work for you, you can always construct a valid File
    URI instead.
