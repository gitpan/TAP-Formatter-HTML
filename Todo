Script still running bug
   * when you navigate away from page
   * only on big test outputs
   * jquery cleanup?

Sometimes test details don't collaps properly!
   * doesn't happen in FireFox 3?
   * related to the scrollTo?
   * could hide & show the tr after the slideToggle?

sort by cols
   * time!
   * test file
   * percent

support file output
   * prove --html=output.html
   * allow output to STDOUT
   * write an App::Prove plugin

wrap unknown test output's in <pre>

expand all tests
expand failed tests

collapse current test (from halway down big tests, maybe a mouseover file or something)

Give the test suite a title...

More tests!
 * parse the generated output
 * check the view given to the TT view
