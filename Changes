Revision history for 'TAP-Formatter-HTML' Perl module
-----------------------------------------------------

All changes by Steve Purkis, unless otherwise noted.

0.05
    +	fixed width issue: test files with hundreds of tests were causing
	uncontrollable width in summary, making the report pretty annoying
	to read.
    +	added toggle to display all / failed tests [requested by Alex Monney]
    +	highlight failed test file names
    +	reduced the size of generated HTML by a further ~10-35% (depending on
	the number of tests you run):
	  * set test title on mouse-over so it's included only once
    *	moved inline JS out of default_report.tt2 to its own file that is
	included by default.
    *	split css into 'page' & 'report' for ease of user maintainability.
	[requested by Steffen Schwigon]
    +	fixed bug: % passed on test file != % ok, was really confusing people.
	[requested by Wolfram Pfeiffer]
    *	upgraded to jquery-1.2.6

0.04
    +	reduced the size of the generated HTML (by 25% on avg for my tests):
	  * added 'minify' option to strip leading tabs
	  * used short css class names
	  * used numeric html id's
	  * got rid of some other unnecessary whitespace

0.03
    +	updated deps in Build.PL (again, *sigh*)

0.02
    +	updated deps in Build.PL
    +	wrote more docs, fixed a few errors & omissions
    -	removed bin/runtests_html (it was added before I found out about 'prove')

0.01
    +	created Thurs May 14 2008
